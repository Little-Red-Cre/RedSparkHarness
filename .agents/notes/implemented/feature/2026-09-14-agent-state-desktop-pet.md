# Agent Note: Agent-state desktop pet

Status: implemented

English | [中文](2026-09-14-agent-state-desktop-pet.zh.md)

## Problem

The RedSpark mascot was welcome-screen decoration owned by Conversation. It could not follow Agent state, persist a presentation choice, float beside an active task, or accept independently supplied characters without changing Conversation code.

## Decision

Create `dsh-client-ui-pet` as the sole owner of desktop-pet registry entries, preferences, semantic activities, copy, and presentation. Conversation declares one session-optional `conversation.pet` slot and requests either `hero` or `floating` placement. The built-in RedSpark entry supplies normal and chibi four-frame atlases. A loopback browser persists one selection for both placements; a remote browser keeps its selection only in its process, with the same twenty-character import limit. Selecting a character always records a variant offered by that character, and third-party variant ids remain distinguishable in the settings UI. Session state derives idle, thinking, waiting, error, and completion; other plugins may report coding, tool work, or sleeping through `ctx.pet` without a runtime import between feature packages. Motion follows the current reduced-motion preference and its changes. The Electron carrier accepts an application-served absolute PNG path without traversal or query, or a bounded embedded PNG frame; state updates refresh it in place, while browser unload and the main process leaving the application document, presenting an emergency document, or losing the renderer close it.

This decision supersedes only the 2026-09-13 RedSpark brand note's alternative that confined character art to the empty welcome screen. That note remains authoritative for product identity, attribution, and provider naming.

## Alternatives considered

**Keep the implementation in Conversation:** rejected because character registration, settings, assets, animation, and Agent-state policy would make the target-neutral Conversation shell a mascot owner.

**Make the Client plugin create Electron windows:** rejected because browser composition must not import Electron or own operating-system lifecycle. The desktop carrier remains an optional presentation adapter with a narrow validated IPC message.

**Bind the mascot to model or theme selection:** rejected for this iteration. Pet identity and presentation are independent user preferences.

## Consequences

The shipped Web composition has one default character, two synchronized variants, and a General > Personalization settings surface. Electron users can also enable a transparent always-on-top desktop window outside a Conversation; unmounting the browser presentation hides that window. Third-party plugins can register additional characters with application-served atlas paths or bounded PNG data and can report semantic activities. The current four-frame atlas reuses poses across several semantic states, and the built-in asset URLs remain owned by the Web deployment.
